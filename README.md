# fs-fuzzer
This repo currently has all the scripts and PoCs, as well as the slides for my presentation @ HITB 2020 Lockdown edition.
I plan on releasing the full fuzzing framework later on.
I still gotta have to do some code clean up and write some README.md things. Stay tuned if you want to test the full thing soon :)
